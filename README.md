# RocketBoard
Not your usual Android keyboard app.

This app provides you with some unique features, like launching an app from any screen just pressing a key on the keyboard.
You can control the brightness of the screen and trigger silent mode directly from the keyboard.

After installation:

In the main screen:
1. Click on "Enable" button in order to register the the keyboard in the Android system. 
2. Click on "Select" button and select Rocketboard as the default input type.

Smart button settings:

1. Launch the app.
2. Click on "Settings".
3. Click on "Smart key settings".
4. Click on the floating action button > Click on "Add user action".
5. Select a key from the drop down.
6. Select the app from the dialog list that you wish to assign to the key.
6. Click on "Add" button.


Usage instructions:

1. Open any screen which allows you to enter text through keyboard.
2. Click on the (...) button which lies to the left of the space bar key. (We'll call this button as the "smart key".)
3. The image of the key will change to a circle. Now click on the key to which you have assigned an app previously.
4. The app will now be launched! :-) (And hence the name is associated to "Rocket", cause you know, it helps you to... er, "launch" apps.)

Other features of the keyboard:
1. smartkey + 'q' key - Decrease brightness of the phone.
2. smartkey + 'w' key - Increase brightness of the phone.
